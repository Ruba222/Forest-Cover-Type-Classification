# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Classification

This project predicts the **type of forest cover** using cartographic and environmental features from the **Covertype Dataset (UCI)**. The task is framed as a **multi-class classification problem**.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling categorical features (encoding)  
- Splitting into training and testing sets  
- Training multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Evaluating performance using metrics like **precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix**  
- Visualizing **feature importance** to understand which environmental variables impact forest cover type  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Scikit-learn (train_test_split, classification models, metrics, OneHotEncoder/LabelEncoder)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Results
- Built a model capable of classifying different forest cover types.  
- Achieved good performance metrics with imbalanced classes considered.  
- Feature importance visualization revealed key predictors such as **elevation, slope, and soil type**.
